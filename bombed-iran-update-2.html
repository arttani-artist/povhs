  <p>Recent reports confirm that the United States warned Israel in advance of its airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. This level of coordination highlights the strategic alignment between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu . Following the U.S. strikes, Trump and Netanyahu spoke directly-making the partnership official .</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br></p>  
  <p><b>June 13</b><br>Israel launches a surprise air campaign against Iran’s nuclear sites (Natanz, Esfahan, and possibly Fordow), plus related military targets. The strikes include heavy air assets and covert Mossad involvement (understandingwar.org).<br>Iran retaliates with ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israel; most are intercepted, but both sides suffer civilian and military casualties (nypost.com).<br><b>June 21</b><br>Israel conducts a second strike on Isfahan, reinforcing their multi-pronged offensive (nypost.com).<br>In response, U.S. deploys six B‑2 stealth bombers (likely configured for massive bunker-buster ordnance) near Guam and Diego Garcia (thetimes.co.uk).<br><b>June 22 (2:30 a.m. IRST)</b><br>U.S. strikes three Iranian nuclear sites: Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, using B‑2 bombers armed with ~30,000‑lb GBU‑57 “Mother of All Bombs” (en.wikipedia.org).<br>Trump declares the mission “very successful,” emphasises peaceful aims, and confirms all aircraft safely returned (wsj.com).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Why It Matters</strong><br></p> 
  <p>Strategic escalation: This is the most direct U.S. involvement in striking Iranian soil since the Soleimani operation in 2020.<br>Limited Iranian retaliation: Iran has pledged counter-strikes but their military capabilities appear constrained compared to earlier conflicts (understandingwar.org).<br>Diplomatic breakdown: The U.S. ramped up militarily after deeming the Geneva talks wasted.<br>Global repercussions: The strikes mark a major policy shift, risking deeper military entanglement in the Middle East (time.com).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>What’s Next</strong><br></p>  
  <p>Iran’s response: High alert for missile or drone retaliation; possible proxy strikes in allied countries.<br>Domestic debate: Calls for Congress to weigh in-questions over constitutional authority for military action continue.<br>Regional stability: The Middle East heads toward a flashpoint as diplomatic routes hang by a thread.<br>The coordinated U.S.–Israel strikes signal a decisive military escalation aimed at crippling Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But without clear evidence of long-term impact-or diplomatic reconciliation-the situation teeters on the edge of deeper regional conflict.</p>
