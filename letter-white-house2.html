        <p>arrived in america in 1604, do you think the native americans liked the pilgrims? there isn't much historical evidence during this time period, but presumably, many historians have said several native american tribes were hostile towards the pilgrims.<br> in the present day, the government would view the pilgrims as illegal immigrants. yes, they (the pilgrims) had permission from the king of england to leave after being jailed and harassed for their religious beliefs. the pilgrims fled to the netherlands and made their way to what would be america, and they would be free to practice their religion.<br> an example of this is the us and mexico. many mexican citizens leave their country illegally to escape poverty. there are also better job opportunities for immigrants in developed countries. the southern border (texas, new mexico, arizona , california) is easier to cross because of the river. border patrol apps are also used by migrants to monitor the border crossings as a way to get in.<br>as an immigrant myself, my parents grew up where they were raids in my hometown and people who were muslim (shia or sunni regardless) were persecuted. narendra modi (chief prime minister of gujrat from 2001-2014) was majorly responsible for these raids against minorities. because of this, my parents made a plan to move to the us while they could. the process of getting documents was long, and getting the green card to permanently reside in the united states was even longer. by the time i was thirteen, i had gotten my citizenship even though my family had lived in the us for over the four necessary years to apply for naturalization.<br>to me, it doesn't matter if someone is an illegal immigrant or or not. every migrant deserves the chance to live safely without fear. we just want to live normally like everyone else.
