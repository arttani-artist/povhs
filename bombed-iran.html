  <p>Late Saturday night, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. carried out airstrikes targeting three Iranian nuclear facilities-Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan-marking a sharp escalation in the ongoing Israel–Iran conflict (foxnews.com, nymag.com).<br>“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran … A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home,” Trump wrote on Truth Social and was echoed in statements reported by CBS News and others (cbsnews.com).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Key Details</strong><br></p>  
  <p><b>Targets:</b> Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (buried deep under a mountain), Natanz nuclear facility, and a site near Esfahan (en.wikipedia.org).<br><b>Aircraft Used:</b> B-2 stealth bombers, potentially carrying the GBU-57 “bunker buster” bomb, were mobilized from Whiteman AFB in Missouri to Guam, then onward to the targets (aftonbladet.se).<br><b>Trump’s Justification:</b> He claimed the operation was decisive and successful, framing it as strategic and in support of Israel, with the phrase: “Now is the time for peace” (aftonbladet.se).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Regional Context & Risks</strong><br></p> 
  <p>These strikes followed a series of Israeli air operations and covert Mossad actions earlier this month targeting Iran’s nuclear and missile infrastructure (en.wikipedia.org).<br>Iran’s leadership had threatened retaliation if the U.S. joined the assault (washingtonpost.com). Regional and international voices urged caution-such as Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who warned against U.S. escalation (economictimes.indiatimes.com).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Potential Consequences</strong><br></p>  
  <p>A significant risk of <b>regional war</b>, including missile exchanges and proxy conflict expansion (nypost.com).<br>Increased pressure on Israel’s defenses, including strains on Iron Dome and emerging threats to civilians (thetimes.co.uk).<br>U.S. political figures weighed in: Senate Republicans praised the strike, while some Democrats and global leaders urged caution and diplomacy.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>What's Next</strong><br></p>  
  <p>Iranian response unknown-Tehran had pledged retaliation, but no confirmation has emerged yet .<br>Trump to address the nation Sunday evening with a live broadcast promising further context and defense ‎(cbsnews.com).<br>Global watch-U.S. allies and adversaries are monitoring for reactions; diplomatic channels remain strained as conflict intensifies.</p>
