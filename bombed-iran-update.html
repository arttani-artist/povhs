  <p>New reports confirm that the United States <b>notified Israel</b> in advance of its coordinated airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday night, underscoring deepened alignment between the Trump administration and the Netanyahu government amid rising regional tensions.<br>According to two officials who spoke to CNN, <b>President Donald Trump</b> and <b>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</b> also held a direct phone call after the U.S. assault, which targeted <b>three major Iranian nuclear sites</b>: Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. The strikes, carried out by B-2 stealth bombers, mark one of the most aggressive military moves by the U.S. in the region since the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani [CNN].</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>What Happened</strong><br></p>  
  <p><b>The U.S. struck three nuclear sites</b>, citing military necessity and regional stability.<br><b>B-2 bombers likely deployed from Guam</b>, carrying GBU-57 “bunker busters” for deep-impact penetration at heavily fortified sites.<br><b>No reported casualties yet</b>, and Iranian state media has not confirmed the full extent of the damage.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Strategic Background: Echoes of 2020</strong><br></p> 
  <p>CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh notes that the <b>military playbook echoes Trump’s 2020 decision</b> to eliminate Soleimani-controversial at the time, but followed by limited Iranian retaliation.<br>"Trump has clearly remembered his experience... Iran had limited force with which to respond and its retaliation had minimal effect," writes Walsh.<br>Now, after a week of missile exchanges between <b>Iran and Israel</br>, the U.S. may have judged that <b>Tehran's arsenal is too depleted</b> to mount a meaningful response. Combined with the failure of recent <b>Geneva diplomacy efforts</b>, Trump may have viewed this strike as a quicker, more effective route to stalling Iran’s nuclear ambitions.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>What’s at Stake</strong><br></p>  
  <p>Iran’s response remains unknown. Previous threats of retaliation have yet to materialize.<br>Diplomatic fallout expected from European allies frustrated by the abandonment of negotiations.<br>No clear evidence yet that the airstrikes have neutralized Iran’s bomb-making potential.<br>This strike also signals a major pivot away from diplomacy, with one White House official stating off record that Friday’s Geneva talks with EU nations were seen as “a waste of time” by the administration.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>The Big Question</strong><br></p>  
  <p><b>Did this operation destroy Iran’s nuclear ambitions-or simply provoke the next stage of conflict?</b><br>If the answer is anything short of definitive, analysts warn the Trump administration may have traded long-term stability for a short-term strategic win-one that could drag the U.S. deeper into confrontation across the region.</p>
