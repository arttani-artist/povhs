  <p>President Donald Trump delivered a nationally televised address late Saturday night, confirming that the U.S. executed coordinated airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities-Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. He emphasized successful mission execution and cooperation with Israel, setting a firm tone of military strength and diplomatic warning (theguardian.com).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Saturday Night Address Summary</strong><br></p>  
  <p>Trump congratulated American forces: “All planes are safely on their way home.”<br>Declared the strikes “historic” and vowed that “Iran must now agree to end this war.”<br>Promoted U.S.-Israeli alignment: “This is a historic moment for the United States, Israel, and the world.”<br>Framed the strike as decisive and restrained-not seeking regime change: “Not looking for a fight … this is about nuclear capabilities.” (nzherald.co.nz).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Lawmakers React</strong><br></p> 
  <p>Republican support: Hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. John Fetterman applauded the strikes as vital for preventing a nuclear-armed Iran (apnews.com).<br>Constitutional concerns: Cross-party critics, including Rep. Thomas Massie, Rep. Ro Khanna, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, warned the action lacked Congressional approval and threatened unchecked executive war power (theguardian.com).<br>Internal MAGA unease: A segment of the MAGA base expressed concern over escalation and lack of congressional input (politico.com).</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Global Implications & Next Steps</strong><br></p>  
  <p>Trouble in the Middle East: Iran has warned of severe retaliation-raising fears of regional war.<br>Diplomatic setback: Trump cited swift military action as an alternative to diplomacy, deeming recent Geneva talks “time-consuming and ineffective”.<br>Congressional pressure: Proposals for a War Powers resolution are emerging to curtail future unilateral strikes (theguardian.com).<br>Iran’s response pending: Tehran’s next move, military or diplomatic, will likely define the conflict’s trajectory.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>What It All Means</strong><br></p>  
  <p>Trump’s speech positioned the strikes as justified and limited-but critics question the legality and consequences. With regional tensions escalating and global eyes watching, the real test lies ahead: will this halt Iran’s nuclear ambition-or deepen a volatile spiral, sidelining diplomacy?</p>
