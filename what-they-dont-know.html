        <p>They don’t know.<br>They’re standing right outside my house of cards<br>frail as the glass heart in me,<br>peering through the cracks of the flimsy structure. <br>And they don’t know.<br>Their eyes bore into me<br>with an intensity strong rivaling the pain that adorns me,<br>clotting the cuts that dress my sullied skin<br>And they don’t know.<br>And I don’t know.<br><br>Their looming gazes blur with tears of my making,<br>blending with the burning stabs that riddle my tainted figure.<br>And they don’t know.<br>They don’t know.<br>They’ll never know.<br><br>That no matter how much these thorns interwine,<br>drawing out the sin that runs through my veins,<br>I’ll enjoy it.<br>If even for a second, <br>I’ll enjoy it.<br>And they will never know.</p>
