<p>In classrooms and libraries across the country, thousands of books are being pulled from shelves—and students are beginning to fight back.<br>According to a recent report from PEN America, more than 15,000 book bans have been enacted in U.S. public schools since 2021, with the majority happening in states like Texas, Florida, Missouri, and Utah. Most of the targeted books feature LGBTQ+ characters, Black or brown authors, or themes of race, gender, and identity.<br>One Texas district recently banned The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe, and All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M. Johnson. In many cases, the books are removed after just one parental complaint, without formal review.<br>“It’s censorship, plain and simple,” said a high school student in Austin, Texas, who asked to remain anonymous. “They don’t want us to learn about lives that are different from our own. But we’re not going to stay quiet.”<br><br></p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Who’s Behind the Bans?</strong><br></p>
<p>The bans are often pushed by conservative activist groups like Moms for Liberty and new state laws that allow for broad definitions of “obscene” or “inappropriate” material. In Florida, for example, books that include any mention of gender or sexuality are at risk of being labeled pornographic—even if they’re award-winning memoirs or history texts.<br>In March, the Iowa House of Representatives passed a bill requiring schools to remove any books that include sex acts—even in historical or educational contexts. A similar law in Missouri led to school librarians facing misdemeanor charges for providing books deemed “inappropriate.”<br><br></p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Students and Librarians Are Pushing Back</strong><br></p>
<p>Despite the pressure, students, teachers, and librarians aren’t giving up. In some districts, teens have organized read-ins, where students gather in hallways or public parks to read banned books aloud. Others have started underground “banned book clubs” or circulated PDFs and scanned copies of banned titles on social media.<br>“Books save lives,” said Miranda Lee, a school librarian in Pennsylvania. “When we erase stories about identity, mental health, and survival, we’re putting kids in danger.”<br>Some legal organizations, like the ACLU and the Freedom to Read Foundation, are challenging these bans in court—arguing that they violate the First Amendment and students’ right to information.<br><br></p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong><strong>Why It Matters</strong><br></strong><br></p>
<p>Experts warn that book bans don’t just erase stories—they erase understanding. “We’re raising a generation with gaps in empathy and critical thinking,” said Dr. Caleb Rosen, an education professor at NYU. “That should scare us more than any book.”<br>As the 2025–26 school year approaches, students around the country are preparing to speak out, organize, and read even louder.<br>“Every time they ban a book,” said the Austin student, “we’re going to read it anyway.”</p>
